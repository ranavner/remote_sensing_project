# remote_sensing_project

Hey there,

I will shortly explain how to run the code:  

1. You have to use Google Colab.
2. place the directory "remote_sensing_ran" with all its content in /content/drive/MyDrive  
3. Inside the main code, replace the gee authentication with your own.

Enjoy!

The project is the the final project assignment in remote sensing course.
